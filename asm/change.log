///////// FUNCTIONAL ASM CONVERTER ///////////

DONE:

-parse every instruction, parameters, and compute size of each instruction
-print name in bytecode
-print size of the program (thanks to the parsing who compute size of each instructions)
-print descriptions in bytecode
-parse every labels
-print instructions:
    -labels adress 
    -register
    -direct
    -indirect

WORK IN PROGRESS:

TODO:

-more and more error handling
